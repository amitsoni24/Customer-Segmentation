# Customer Segmentation

## 1. About the Dataset
This project focuses on customer segmentation using historical data to enable personalized recommendations. The dataset includes customer information such as income, spending behavior, and other relevant features that are used to group customers into meaningful segments.

## 2. Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Segment customers into clusters based on their historical data.
- Enable personalized recommendations and targeted marketing strategies by understanding customer behavior.
- Gain in-depth insights into customer segments for better decision-making.

## 3. Approach
The project follows these steps:
- **Feature Engineering & EDA:**
  - Conducted feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Probability Density Function (PDF) plots and correlation matrices to visualize feature distributions and relationships.
- **Clustering Methods:**
  - Applied various clustering techniques including:
    - K-means++ for partitioning into clusters.
    - Hierarchical clustering to create a dendrogram.
    - DB-SCAN for density-based clustering.
  - Used the elbow method and Dunn Index to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
  - Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
  - Visualized clustering results using 3D plots to better understand the cluster formations.

## 4. Results & Key Features
- **Segmentation:** Identified 4 distinct customer segments based on income and spending behavior.
- **Insights:** Gained in-depth insights into customer segments, which can be used for targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.
